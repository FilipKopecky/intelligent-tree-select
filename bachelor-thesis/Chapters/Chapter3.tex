In this chapter, I will compare three existing solutions. I choose these three solutions because they are the solutions with the highest number of downloads (more than 5000 per month. In case of rc-tree select 270 thousand per month). Also, all three solutions have most of their functionality similar or same to mine. These similar features are:
\begin{itemize}
\item selecting/ multi-selecting options
\item displaying data as a tree or as a list
\item toggle/ expand function for each option with children options
\item filtering/ highlighting results
\end{itemize}

So I will not compare these functionalities, only the benefits, and disadvantages of each solution.

\section{React dropdown tree select}

One of the alternatives to my work is React dropdown tree select \parencite{react-dropdown-tree-select}.

      \hline 
      \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Pros}} & 
      \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Cons}}

	{\tablename\ \thetable\ -- \textit{Continued from previous page}} \\

        Design can be overridden to match Bootstrap \parencite{bootstrap} or Material design \parencite{material_design} frameworks.
        & All nodes are collapsed by default and cannot be expanded altogether. \\
        \hline
        Search debouncing - The tree debounces key presses to avoid costly search calculations. The default duration is 100ms. 
        & Cannot collapse/ uncollapse tree nodes during a search. \\
        \hline
        & Component does not support highlighting of matched text during a search. \\
        \hline
        & Component does not support asynchronous data loading. \\
        \hline
        & Data must have label and value properties. \\
        \hline
        & Data cannot be represented as an array of graph nodes.  Parent node must have child property to display children nodes and so on. This main problem with this approach is that for manipulating with some node, you need whole tree branch. Also, it is hard to calculate the length (total number of options) in this data structure. \\
        \hline
        & Renders all relevant options at once, this can slow performance of the component. \\
        \hline

\section{RC tree select}

First competitive solution is a React tree select component \parencite{rc-tree}. However, as I found out this solution is just a React solution of Ant design component. Moreover, nowadays Ant design components work with React as well so I do not see a point to use this component.

\begin{center}
    \begin{longtable}{|p{7cm}|p{7cm}|}
      \hline 
      \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Pros}} & 
      \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Cons}}
      \endfirsthead
      \multicolumn{2}{c}%
	{\tablename\ \thetable\ -- \textit{Continued from previous page}} \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Pros}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Cons}} \\
    \endhead
    \multicolumn{2}{r}{\textit{Continued on next page}} \\
	\endfoot
    \hline
	\endlastfoot
    \hline
      & Does not support highlighting of matched text during search. \\
      \hline
      & Selected items can be removed only via checkboxes. Other solutions have small '$\times$' button that can remove corresponding option. But in the case of this solution you need at least two steps to remove a selected option. (1. find that option 2. uncheck it) \\
      \hline
      & Renders all relevant options at once which can slow performance of the component. \\
      \hline
    \end{longtable}
\end{center}

\section{Ant design tree select}

Last one is a tree select from Ant design \parencite{Ant.Design}. 

\begin{center}
    \begin{longtable}{|p{7cm}|p{7cm}|}
      \hline 
      \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Pros}} & 
      \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Cons}}
      \endfirsthead
      \multicolumn{2}{c}%
	{\tablename\ \thetable\ -- \textit{Continued from previous page}} \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Pros}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Cons}} \\
    \endhead
    \multicolumn{2}{r}{\textit{Continued on next page}} \\
	\endfoot
    \hline

    \hline
      Complete ecosystem with other Ant design components.
      & Render all relevant options at once this can slow performance of the component. \\
      \hline
      Maintained and updated on a regular basis by the Ant UED team.
      & Does not cashed previous search result. For every new character (searched string)
      they filter through original data set. \\
      \hline
      Solutions for other UI frameworks like Angular, Vue, Ember and ClojureScript
      & \\
      \hline

\section{Summary of the related works}

Each of these solutions provides expected functionality from this type of component. Also, these component are popular to use, that supports a fact of the high download rate. On the other hand, none of these components is useful for rendering a large number of options. Moreover, none provide the functionality of Intelligent tree select component such as support of multiple data providers.
